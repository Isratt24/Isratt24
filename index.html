<h3> About me</h3>
<p> My name is Israt Tanha,I'm a sophomore, and specializing in design and web development.
    I really enjoy coding since the very beginning of my middle school. 
    Which means I already knew the basic idea of the programing. I also joined a coding club during my 
    freshman year, which was very helpful, in opening my knowledge towards coding.
