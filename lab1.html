    <h4>Many people commonly knows Aurora Borealis by the name Northern lights. 
        They appear in a clear night sky as swirling rivers of greenish-blue light.
         They move and dance unpredictably; sometimes barely perceptible,
          then suddenly growing vivid. In simple terms, the auroras can be explained as an interaction of the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field.
          They are mainly caused by electrically charged particles that are released by the Sun. 
          They last no longer than 15-30 minutes,but they are unpredicable so if your lucky it last up to couple of hours.
